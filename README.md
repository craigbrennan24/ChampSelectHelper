# ChampSelectHelper
--------
A simple program designed to help League of Legends players easily filter their champion pool during champion select by utilizing the filtering capabilities of the search function

This program is free to use with no ads, you can help me out by recommending this to your friends!

Be sure to take correct version! ChampSelectHelper32/64 = 32 bit/64 bit

### How-To:  
Inside the 'data' folder there is a file called 'data.txt', this is where you can add and remove champions
from your pool.  
Each role must be on it's own line and the first item in the list **must** be the name of the role, you can change this to whatever
you wish.    
Format:  
```
"role_name","champion1","champion2","champion3"
```
"role_name" will be the text that appears on the button, change as you like.  
Example:  
```
"AD TOP","Darius","Garen","Riven"
```
The champions do not need to be in alphabetical order.

After downloading, the only folder you need is the one named "ChampSelectHelper" with the correct version (32/64 bit)
