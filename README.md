# ChampSelectHelper
--------
A simple program designed to help League of Legends players easily filter their champion pool during champion select by utilizing the filtering capabilities of the search function

This program is free to use with no ads! You can help me out by recommending this program to your friends!


### How-To:  
Inside the 'data' folder there is a file called 'data.txt', this is where you can add and remove champions
from your pool.  
Each role must be on it's own line and the first item in the list **must** be the name of the role, you can change this to whatever
you wish.    
Format:  
```
"role_name","champion1","champion2","champion3"
```


### Planned features:


* Make adding and removing champions from your roles possible during runtime
* Custom roles
* Select multiple roles at once
* Code optimization
